- Secure Password Hashing: User passwords are securely hashed using Bcrypt.
- Email Support: The application uses Flask-Mail for email functionality.
- API Key Management: Users can set their own API keys for the OpenAI service.
- Cover Letter Generation: Users can generate a custom cover letter by providing details such as job title, job description, employer name, employer description, and additional instructions.
- Downloadable Cover Letters: Generated cover letters can be downloaded as text files.
